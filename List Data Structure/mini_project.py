"""
You have a record of n students. Each record contains the student's name, and their percent marks in Math, Physics and Chemistry. The marks can be floating values. You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type.

Student's name is the key. Marks stored in a list is the value. The user enters a student's name. Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student.

Formula: (sum of marks) / (no of subjects)

Sample Input: {

"Krishna":

[67, 68, 69],

"Arjun"

: (70, 98, 63],

"Malika": [52, 56, 60]}

Sample output:

Enter a name: Malika

Average percentage mark: 56

Explanation:

Marks for Malika are [52, 56, 60] whose average is (52+56+60)/3 =>56
